## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please
report it privately and do **not** create a public GitHub issue or post details
publicly.

### How to report

You can report vulnerabilities using one of the following methods:

- **GitHub Security Advisories (preferred):**  
  Go to the repository on GitHub, open the **Security** tab, and choose
  **“Report a vulnerability”**. This will create a private security advisory
  that is visible only to the maintainers and you.
- **Email:**  
  Send an email to `security@example.com` with the subject line
  `Security report: <short description>`.

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the issue and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (proof-of-concept if available).
- Any known affected versions and configuration details.
- Any ideas you have for possible fixes or mitigations.

### Response and handling process

- We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**.
- We will triage the report, assess severity, and keep you informed of the
  progress at least every **7 business days** until a resolution is available
  or the report is closed.
- If the vulnerability is **accepted**, we will:
  - Work to develop and test a fix.
  - Prepare a release and, where appropriate, a security advisory describing
    the issue, impact, and remediation steps.
  - Coordinate disclosure timing with you where possible, and can credit you
    in the advisory if you wish.
- If the report is **declined** (for example, if it is out of scope, cannot be
  reproduced, or is considered low-risk), we will explain our reasoning and, if
  applicable, suggest alternative mitigations.

Please give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the
issue before you disclose it publicly.
