## How to Manage Wiki Pages

This Home page manage wikis by category group.

Absence of category declaration worsens maintainability and searchability.  
Kindly make sure to articulate `Category: CATEGORY_NAME` of the top of each of your wiki page to avoid it.

Also, please keep in mind that you do not have to edit Home and Sidebar by yourself, which are automatically updated by a GitHub Actions cron job.
