## How to Manage Wiki Pages

This Home page manage wikis by owner group.

Absence of ownership declaration worsens maintainability and searchability because it makes ambiguous which team the responsibility belongs to.  
Kindly make sure to articulate `Owner: @OWNER_TEAM` of the top of each of your wiki page to avoid it.

Also, please keep in mind that you do not have to edit Home and Sidebar by yourself, which are automatically updated by a GitHub Actions cron job.
